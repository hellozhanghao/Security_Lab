Introduction
--------------------------------
RainbowCrack is a general propose implementation of Philippe Oechslin's faster time-memory trade-off technique.
It cracks hashes with rainbow tables.

- Improved performance of NVIDIA GPU acceleration (CUDA technology)

Changes in version 1.5
- Support 64-bit Windows operating systems
- Support 32-bit Linux operating systems (x86 only)
- Support 64-bit Linux operating systems (x86_64 only)
- Support rainbow table file larger than 2 GB

Changes in version 1.4.1
- Improved performance of rcrack and rcrack_gui program

Changes in version 1.4
- New compact rainbow table file format (.rtc) reduce rainbow table size by 50% to 56.25%
- New rt2rtc utility convert rainbow table from raw file format (.rt) to compact file format (.rtc)
- New rtc2rt utility convert rainbow table from compact file format (.rtc) to raw file format (.rt)
